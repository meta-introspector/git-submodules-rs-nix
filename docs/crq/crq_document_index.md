## CRQ Document Index: A Guide to the Lattice Idea Framework's Conceptual Development

This document serves as an index and guide to the various Conceptual Research Questions (CRQ) documents that detail the development, implications, and applications of the Lattice Idea Framework. Each CRQ document explores a specific facet of the framework, contributing to its comprehensive understanding.

### Index of CRQ Documents

*   **[Zos Sequence Self-Application: Iterative Attribute Expansion](zos_self_application.md)**
    *   **Description:** Explores the meta-application of the `zos` sequence to itself, demonstrating how it iteratively expands the descriptive attributes of models by adding new predicates, aspects, or morphisms.

*   **[Lattice Code Generation and Mapping: Addressing and Organizing Knowledge](lattice_code_generation_and_mapping.md)**
    *   **Description:** Details how the parameters of the lattice code generator define the address of generated objects within the lattice, and the process of generating a directory hierarchy that reflects the lattice, followed by mapping existing code into this structure by similarity.

*   **[LLM Communication Protocol: Audited, Controlled, Curried, and Continuable](llm_communication_protocol.md)**
    *   **Description:** Outlines the conceptual design for a robust communication protocol for LLMs, emphasizing auditing, control, currying for contextual pre-filling, and continuation for stateful interaction.

*   **[Rust Code Generation for Lattice Structures: Programmatic Construction of the Framework](rust_code_generation_for_lattice.md)**
    *   **Description:** Describes the process of programmatically generating Rust code for the Lattice Idea Framework's core structures using `syn` and `quote`, and the creation of a callable code generation module.

*   **[Conceptual Rust Implementation: The Lattice of Types](conceptual_rust_lattice_types.md)**
    *   **Description:** Details the conceptual Rust implementation of the Lattice Idea Framework's core data structures using enums, structs, traits, and generics, representing the multi-layered lattice.

*   **[K-Value Type Semantics: Expanding Predicate Granularity in the Lattice](k_value_type_semantics.md)**
    *   **Description:** Defines the semantic interpretation of different `k`-value types (2, 3, 5, 7, ..., 19) within the lattice, mapping them to boolean predicates, relational statements, contextualized statements, and higher-order models.

*   **[Meta-Lattice Application: N-grams on K=19 Tuples for a Level 2 Lattice](meta_lattice_application.md)**
    *   **Description:** Proposes applying n-gram analysis to the values of `k=19` tuples, creating a "Level 2 Lattice" and demonstrating the recursive and fractal nature of the framework.

*   **[Concrete Lattice Analysis Example: Identifying Repeating Patterns in N-grams](concrete_lattice_analysis_example.md)**
    *   **Description:** Outlines a specific analytical workflow for finding repeating elements and patterns within selected top N n-grams across specific layers, demonstrating practical application.

*   **[Audited and Controlled LLM Interaction: Ensuring Trust and Transparency in Knowledge Extraction](audited_llm_interaction.md)**
    *   **Description:** Focuses on the critical aspects of auditing and control within the LLM communication protocol, emphasizing how the lattice provides the framework for traceability, control, and reliability.

*   **[Open-Source Language and Compiler Classification: The 1k Repo Grounding](oss_language_classification_crq.md)**
    *   **Description:** Proposes classifying open-source programming languages and compilers within the framework, emphasizing "vibes" and "memes," and the crucial assertion that understanding one repository requires grounding from approximately 1,000 others.

This index will be updated as new CRQ documents are developed, providing a comprehensive overview of the Lattice Idea Framework's evolving conceptual landscape.
