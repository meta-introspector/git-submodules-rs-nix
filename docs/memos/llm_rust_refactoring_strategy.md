# Memo: LLM Rust Refactoring Strategy for `wikipedia_extractor`

## Problem
Repeated edit errors have occurred when attempting to modify the `wikipedia_extractor/src/lib.rs` file, primarily due to `old_string` mismatches with the `replace` tool. This indicates that the current monolithic structure of `lib.rs` is difficult to manage programmatically and is prone to errors during automated modifications.

## Proposed Solution
Refactor the `wikipedia_extractor` crate by splitting the `src/lib.rs` file into multiple smaller, more focused modules. This will improve modularity, readability, and maintainability, and significantly reduce the likelihood of `replace` tool errors by localizing changes to smaller, more predictable file contexts.

## Refactoring Plan
1.  **Create new modules:** Identify logical units within `lib.rs` (e.g., `wikipedia_parser.rs`, `wikidata_client.rs`, `data_structures.rs`, `tests.rs`).
2.  **Move code:** Migrate relevant functions, structs, and tests to their respective new modules.
3.  **Update `lib.rs`:** Modify `lib.rs` to re-export items from the new modules and maintain the public API.
4.  **Adjust `use` statements:** Update `use` statements across the crate to reflect the new module structure.
5.  **Verify:** Run `cargo test` to ensure all functionality remains intact and no new warnings or errors are introduced.

## Impact
This refactoring will make the `wikipedia_extractor` crate easier to develop, debug, and extend. It will also enable more precise and reliable automated code modifications in the future, reducing the friction caused by current editing limitations.
