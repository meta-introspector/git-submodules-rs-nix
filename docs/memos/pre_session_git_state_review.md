# Pre-Session Git State Review

## Purpose
This document reviews the state of the Git repository at the beginning of the current session, specifically identifying changes that were present before the agent began working on the `git diff` documentation tasks. This helps in understanding the repository's context and any pre-existing modifications or untracked files.

## Git Status Overview (Prior to Current Session's Work)

At the start of the session, the `git status` command revealed the following:

### 1. Modified Submodule: `.emacs.d/terlar-emacs-config`
*   **Status**: `modified: .emacs.d/terlar-emacs-config (modified content, untracked content)`
*   **Diff**: The `git diff` output showed a change from `Subproject commit 397c1e795e4a84458609e4f42ef4b1f4e02f4afb` to `Subproject commit 397c1e795e4a84458609e4f42ef4b1f4e02f4afb-dirty`.
*   **Interpretation**: This indicates that the `terlar-emacs-config` submodule, located within the `.emacs.d/` directory, contains local modifications or untracked files within its own working directory. The `-dirty` suffix signifies that the submodule's state is not clean relative to its recorded commit in the superproject. This change was pre-existing and not introduced by the agent during this session.

### 2. Untracked Files and Directories
*   **Status**: The following files and directories were listed as untracked:
    *   `docs/sops/SOP_Debugging_Magit_Nix_Emacs.md`
    *   `tools/debug-emacs/`
*   **Interpretation**: These files and directories exist in the working directory but are not currently being tracked by Git. They were present before the agent started working on the `git diff` documentation and were not created as part of the current session's tasks.

## Conclusion
The repository contained pre-existing modifications within the `.emacs.d/terlar-emacs-config` submodule and several untracked files/directories (`docs/sops/SOP_Debugging_Magit_Nix_Emacs.md`, `tools/debug-emacs/`). These items were not introduced during the current session and represent the state of the repository before the agent's recent work on `git diff` documentation.
