# CRQ-061-Standardize-Submodule-Precommit-Hooks.md

## Change Request: Standardize Pre-commit Hooks for All Submodules

### Objective
To implement a standardized and automated system for managing Git pre-commit hooks across all project submodules, with an initial focus on integrating `shellcheck` for shell script quality assurance.

### Description
Currently, Git pre-commit hooks are managed on a per-repository basis, leading to potential inconsistencies in code quality enforcement, especially within submodules. This CRQ proposes a solution to centralize the management of pre-commit hooks, ensuring that all submodules automatically inherit and enforce project-wide code quality standards.

The initial implementation will focus on:
1.  **Centralized Template:** Creating a single, authoritative template for the pre-commit hook in the main repository.
2.  **Automated Deployment:** Developing a mechanism (e.g., a script) to automatically deploy and update this pre-commit hook to all existing and newly added submodules.
3.  **`shellcheck` Integration:** The initial standardized hook will include `shellcheck` to enforce best practices and identify common errors in shell scripts before they are committed.
4.  **Documentation:** Providing clear Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for the setup, maintenance, and usage of these standardized hooks.

### Expected Outcome
*   Consistent application of code quality checks (starting with `shellcheck`) across all submodules.
*   Reduced manual effort in setting up and maintaining pre-commit hooks in individual submodules.
*   Improved overall code quality and fewer shell scripting errors in the codebase.
*   Clear documentation for developers on how pre-commit hooks are managed.

### Justification/Benefit
*   **Enhanced Code Quality:** Proactive identification and prevention of shell scripting issues at the commit stage.
*   **Increased Efficiency:** Automates a previously manual and error-prone process, saving developer time.
*   **Improved Consistency:** Ensures all parts of the codebase adhere to the same quality standards.
*   **Easier Onboarding:** New contributors will automatically benefit from established quality checks without manual setup.

### Dependencies
*   Availability of `shellcheck` in the development environment (to be addressed in related Nix configurations).
*   Git submodule functionality.
*   Agreement on the content of the centralized pre-commit hook template.
*   The `SOP_Standardize_Submodule_Precommit_Hooks.md` document.
