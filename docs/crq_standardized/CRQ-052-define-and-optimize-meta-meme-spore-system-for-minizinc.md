**CRQ: Define and Optimize Meta-Meme Spore System for MiniZinc**

**Problem/Goal:**
The primary goal is to define and optimize the "Meta-Meme Spore" system for recursive optimization using MiniZinc, AI, LLMs, custom alife, genetic algorithms, and meta-memes. This involves translating abstract concepts into quantifiable parameters and constraints suitable for a MiniZinc model, and clarifying foundational elements such as system definition, resource constraints, optimization goals, and tool integration.

**Proposed Solution:**
Address the open questions outlined in `meta-meme-spore-context.md` to formalize the system's definition. This includes:
1.  **System Definition and Dimensionality:** Clarify the interpretation of primorial dimensions, model the "spore" and "mycology" aspects, and understand the influence of "Monster Group" and "GÃ¶del Number."
2.  **Resource Constraints and Allocation:** Detail RAM distribution for 8-bit with 6KB RAM and consider AWS Free-Tier Micro Instance constraints.
3.  **Optimization Goals and Metrics:** Quantify "making money" and "tokenizing memes" as objective functions, and integrate "Lisp and Oldest Meta Memes."
4.  **Interoperability and Tool Integration:** Define the roles of AI/LLMs, custom alife, and genetic algorithms in the optimization loop.
The output will be a well-defined problem statement and potentially initial MiniZinc models.

**Justification/Impact:**
This CRQ is crucial for enabling the recursive optimization of the "Meta-Meme Spore" system. By clearly defining the problem for MiniZinc, we can:
-   Develop a robust optimization framework.
-   Gain insights into resource allocation and system behavior.
-   Facilitate the integration of AI, LLMs, and genetic algorithms for complex problem-solving.
-   Move closer to the vision of monetizing and tokenizing memes within a structured, optimized environment.
