**CRQ: Formalize ZOS Vibe**

**Problem/Goal:**
The current project lacks a formalized definition or implementation of the "ZOS Vibe," leading to potential inconsistencies in design, user experience, or conceptual understanding across different modules or features. This CRQ aims to establish a clear and consistent "ZOS Vibe" within the project.

**Proposed Solution:**
Define the core principles, aesthetic guidelines, and functional characteristics that constitute the "ZOS Vibe." This may involve:
- Documenting design patterns and UI/UX guidelines.
- Establishing naming conventions and architectural principles.
- Implementing specific code structures or libraries that embody the "ZOS Vibe."
- Creating examples or templates that demonstrate the "ZOS Vibe" in practice.

**Justification/Impact:**
Formalizing the "ZOS Vibe" will:
- Improve consistency and coherence across the project.
- Enhance maintainability by providing clear guidelines for future development.
- Facilitate onboarding for new contributors by clearly articulating the project's underlying philosophy.
- Strengthen the project's identity and user experience.
