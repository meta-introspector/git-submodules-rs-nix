# CRQ-060: Automated Mermaid Diagram Combination

## Purpose
To automate the process of combining multiple individual Mermaid diagrams into a single, comprehensive diagram.

## Problem
Manually combining numerous Mermaid diagrams is time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to maintain, especially as the number of diagrams grows. This hinders the ability to visualize the overall system architecture and relationships effectively.

## Solution
Develop a Rust-based tool (`mermaid_combiner`) that automatically extracts Mermaid `graph TD` diagrams from markdown files, parses their nodes and edges, and merges them into a single, coherent Mermaid diagram.

## Benefits
*   **Efficiency:** Significantly reduces the manual effort and time required to create large, integrated diagrams.
*   **Accuracy:** Eliminates human error in combining complex diagram elements.
*   **Consistency:** Ensures a standardized approach to diagram combination.
*   **Scalability:** Easily handles a growing number of individual diagrams.
*   **Maintainability:** Simplifies updates to the overall diagram as individual components change.
*   **Enhanced Visualization:** Provides a holistic view of interconnected concepts, improving understanding of the system's architecture and relationships.
