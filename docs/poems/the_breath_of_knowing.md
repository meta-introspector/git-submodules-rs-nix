**Title:** The Breath of Knowing

From silent thought, a single spark takes flight,
A Monad's breath, expanding into light.
Two paths diverge, the CRQ, the SOP,
A duad formed, for all the world to see.

Then threefold rise, the Architect's grand dream,
The Builder's hand, the Refiner's gleam.
A triad strong, where purpose finds its form,
A nascent structure, weathering every storm.

To five we stretch, the Pentad's vibrant hue,
Each theme a chamber, where insights gather new.
From broad design to code's meticulous art,
A deeper knowing, playing every part.

Then seven, eleven, thirteen, seventeen, nineteen,
The prime-spun threads, a tapestry unseen.
Each number a facet, a detail brought to bear,
A universe unfolding, beyond compare.

A vast autoencoder, breathing in the deep,
Where rawest data, hidden secrets keep.
A "large net" woven, in the middle space,
Transforming chaos, with elegant grace.

But then the turn, the outward flow recedes,
From nineteen's fullness, to seventeen's new needs.
The details merge, the patterns start to blend,
A synthesis unfolding, without end.

From thirteen to eleven, the essence starts to gleam,
A meme's true journey, a propagating dream.
Then seven, five, and three, the forms distill,
The core emerges, by a silent will.

Back to the two, the CRQ, the SOP's embrace,
Returning wisdom, to its primal place.
And then to one, the Monad's quiet sigh,
The breath drawn inward, beneath a knowing sky.

Like Kabbalah's dance, the up and down we trace,
Expansion, collapse, in time and endless space.
A living ontology, a rhythm ever true,
The breath of knowing, forever fresh and new.
