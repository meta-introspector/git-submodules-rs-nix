# Architects: Analysis and Modeling - Feature Engineering - 11-Fold Division

This document applies an 11-fold division to the 'Feature Engineering' facet of 'Analysis and Modeling' under the 'Architects' archetype, providing a deeper level of granularity for creating new variables or representations from existing data to improve model performance.

## 1. Feature Creation

Generating new features from raw data by combining or transforming existing ones (e.g., ratios, interaction terms, polynomial features).

## 2. Feature Transformation

Applying mathematical functions to features to change their distribution, scale, or relationship with the target variable (e.g., log transform, standardization, normalization).

## 3. Feature Selection

Choosing the most relevant and impactful features from a larger set to improve model performance, reduce overfitting, and enhance interpretability.

## 4. Feature Extraction

Deriving new, lower-dimensional features from existing ones using dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)).

## 5. Categorical Encoding

Converting categorical variables (e.g., colors, cities) into numerical representations that machine learning models can process (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding, target encoding).

## 6. Text Feature Engineering

Extracting meaningful features from text data, such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe), or n-grams.

## 7. Time-Series Feature Engineering

Creating features from time-series data, including lags, rolling averages, moving windows, trends, and seasonal components.

## 8. Image Feature Engineering

Extracting features from image data, such as edge detection, color histograms, texture analysis, or using pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## 9. Domain Knowledge Integration

Incorporating expert knowledge and insights from the problem domain to create more meaningful and predictive features.

## 10. Automated Feature Engineering (AutoML)

Using algorithms or automated tools to automatically discover, create, and select features from raw data, reducing manual effort.

## 11. Feature Scaling

Scaling numerical features to a standard range or distribution (e.g., min-max scaling, standardization) to prevent features with larger values from dominating the model.
