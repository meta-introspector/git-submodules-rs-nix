# Refiners: Code Quality and Maintenance - Code Smells - 17-Fold Division

This document applies a 17-fold division to the 'Code Smells' facet of 'Technical Debt Identification' under the 'Refiners' archetype, providing a deeper level of granularity for recognizing patterns in code that indicate underlying design problems.

## 1. Duplicated Code

Identical or very similar code blocks appearing in multiple places, leading to increased maintenance effort and potential inconsistencies.

## 2. Long Method

Methods or functions that are excessively long and perform too many responsibilities, making them difficult to understand, test, and maintain.

## 3. Large Class

Classes that have too many responsibilities, too many instance variables, or too many lines of code, violating the Single Responsibility Principle.

## 4. Feature Envy

A method that seems more interested in a class other than the one it lives in, often accessing data from another object more than its own.

## 5. Data Clumps

Groups of data items (e.g., customer name, address, phone number) that always appear together, suggesting they should be encapsulated in their own object.

## 6. Primitive Obsession

Excessive use of primitive data types instead of creating small objects for concepts that deserve their own type (e.g., using `int` for money).

## 7. Switch Statements

Long and complex switch statements or conditional logic that can often be replaced by polymorphism, leading to more extensible code.

## 8. Parallel Inheritance Hierarchies

When you create a subclass for one class, you have to create a corresponding subclass for another class, indicating a missing abstraction.

## 9. Lazy Class

A class that does too little to be worth its existence, often a result of refactoring that removed responsibilities without removing the class.

## 10. Speculative Generality

Code that is written for future needs that never materialize, leading to unnecessary complexity and unused abstractions.

## 11. Temporary Field

An instance variable that is only set in certain circumstances or used for a temporary calculation, indicating a misplaced responsibility.

## 12. Message Chains

A client requests an object, that object requests another object, and so on, creating a long chain of dependencies and tight coupling.

## 13. Middle Man

A class that does nothing but delegate to another class, adding unnecessary indirection and complexity.

## 14. Inappropriate Intimacy

Two classes that are too closely coupled, often accessing each other's private members or relying too heavily on each other's internal structure.

## 15. Alternative Classes with Different Interfaces

Two classes that do the same thing but have different method names, making it harder to swap them out or understand their common purpose.

## 16. Comments (Bad)

Comments that are redundant, misleading, explain bad code, or are simply noise, hindering rather than helping understanding.

## 17. Shotgun Surgery

Making many small changes in many different classes for a single modification, indicating a lack of cohesion or proper encapsulation.
