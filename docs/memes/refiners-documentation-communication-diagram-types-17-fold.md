# Refiners: Documentation and Communication - Diagram Types - 17-Fold Division

This document applies a 17-fold division to the 'Diagram Types' facet of 'Visual Elements' under the 'Refiners' archetype, providing a deeper level of granularity for the various kinds of visual representations used in documentation.

## 1. Flowcharts

Representing processes, workflows, algorithms, or decision paths using standardized symbols and connecting lines.

## 2. Sequence Diagrams

Illustrating the order of interactions between objects or components over time, often used in software design.

## 3. Architecture Diagrams

Depicting the high-level structure, components, and relationships of a system, often showing logical or physical views.

## 4. UML Diagrams

Unified Modeling Language diagrams, including class, object, use case, activity, state machine, and component diagrams, for software design.

## 5. Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)

Modeling the relationships between entities in a database or information system, showing attributes and cardinalities.

## 6. Network Diagrams

Visualizing network topology, devices, connections, and data flow within a computer network.

## 7. Mind Maps

Organizing ideas and information hierarchically and associatively around a central concept, often used for brainstorming.

## 8. Gantt Charts

Project scheduling and progress tracking, showing tasks, durations, dependencies, and timelines.

## 9. Swimlane Diagrams

Representing processes or workflows, showing responsibilities across different roles, departments, or systems.

## 10. State Machine Diagrams

Illustrating the different states an object or system can have and the transitions between them in response to events.

## 11. Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)

Showing how data moves through a system, including processes, data stores, external entities, and data flows.

## 12. Component Diagrams

Illustrating the organization and dependencies among software components, often showing interfaces and ports.

## 13. Deployment Diagrams

Visualizing the physical deployment of software artifacts on hardware nodes, including servers, devices, and network connections.

## 14. Decision Trees

Representing decision rules and their possible consequences in a tree-like structure, often used for classification or prediction.

## 15. Venn Diagrams

Showing logical relationships between sets of items, illustrating commonalities and differences.

## 16. Infographics

Combining text, images, and data visualizations to present complex information quickly and clearly, often for a broad audience.

## 17. Customer Journey Maps

Visualizing the customer's experience with a product or service over time, from initial contact to post-purchase interactions.
