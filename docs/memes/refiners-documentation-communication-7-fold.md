Organizing documentation for easy navigation, discoverability, and logical flow, ensuring users can quickly find the information they need.

## 3. Communication Channels

The various platforms, tools, and methods used for information exchange within the project, such as meetings, chat, email, and forums.

## 5. Feedback and Iteration

Establishing mechanisms for collecting input, reviewing suggestions, and continuously improving documentation and communication strategies.

## 6. Version Control and Publishing

Managing changes to documentation, ensuring version consistency, and making it accessible through appropriate publishing platforms.
