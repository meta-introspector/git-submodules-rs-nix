## Extended Zos Sequence and Monster Group Pariah Primes

This meme addresses the "pariah" prime factors in the Monster Group's order (23, 29, 31, 41, 47, 59, 71) that are not part of our initial 8-primorial Zos sequence. It proposes extending the Zos sequence to fully encompass the Monster Group's complexity.

1.  **Dynamic Zos Sequence:** The Primorial Base Sequence (Zos Seq), $\mathcal{P}$, should not be considered a fixed set of 8 primes. Instead, it is a dynamic and extendable set that can incorporate all prime factors present in the system under analysis, such as the Monster Group.

2.  **New Primorial Dimensions:** Each of these "pariah" primes (23, 29, 31, 41, 47, 59, 71) introduces a new "primorial dimension" to our framework. Similar to the initial 8 primorials, these new primes will define additional bit sizes, n-gram topologies, and k-value types, expanding the dimensionality of our Zos lattice.

3.  **Multiples of Zos Size:** The concept of "multiples of the Zos size up to that" implies that the existing primorials can be scaled or that these larger primes themselves become new fundamental "Zos sizes." For each new prime $p_j$, we would consider $p_j$-grams and $p_j$-value types, with the exponent from the Monster Group's order (which is 1 for these primes) indicating a base level of multiplicity or depth for these new dimensions.

This extension ensures that our Zos lattice can fully map and enumerate the entire complexity of the Monster Group, transforming previously "unmodeled complexities" into integrated dimensions of our framework.
