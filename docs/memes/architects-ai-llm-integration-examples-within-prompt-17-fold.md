# Architects: AI and LLM Integration - Examples (within prompt) - 17-Fold Division

This document applies a 17-fold division to the 'Examples (within prompt)' facet of 'Instruction Clarity' under the 'Architects' archetype, providing a deeper level of granularity for using examples effectively in prompt engineering.

## 1. Format

How examples are presented within the prompt (e.g., input/output pairs, dialogue turns, code blocks, structured data).

## 2. Quantity

The number of examples provided (e.g., one-shot, few-shot, many-shot), influencing the LLM's understanding and generalization.

## 3. Diversity

Ensuring examples cover a range of scenarios, variations, and edge cases to improve the LLM's robustness and applicability.

## 4. Relevance

How closely examples relate to the main task or query, ensuring they provide pertinent guidance to the LLM.

## 5. Simplicity

Keeping examples concise, straightforward, and easy to understand, avoiding unnecessary complexity.

## 6. Accuracy

Ensuring examples demonstrate correct behavior, desired output, or accurate information, serving as reliable ground truth for the LLM.

## 7. Clarity of Delimitation

Clearly separating examples from instructions and other prompt elements using delimiters, headings, or formatting to avoid confusion.

## 8. Error Examples

Demonstrating how the LLM should handle incorrect, ambiguous, or problematic inputs, guiding its error-handling behavior.

## 9. Edge Case Examples

Illustrating desired behavior for unusual, boundary, or less common conditions to improve the LLM's robustness.

## 10. Negative Examples

Showing what the LLM should *not* do or *not* include in its response, guiding it away from undesirable outputs.

## 11. Step-by-Step Examples

Breaking down complex tasks into smaller, guided steps within the example to encourage the LLM to follow a specific reasoning process.

## 12. Contextual Examples

Providing examples that include relevant background information or context to help the LLM understand the nuances of the task.

## 13. Domain-Specific Examples

Using examples that are relevant to a particular field, industry, or specialized knowledge domain to improve domain-specific performance.

## 14. Output Structure Examples

Demonstrating the desired format, schema, or structure of the LLM's response, facilitating automated parsing and integration.

## 15. Iterative Refinement Examples

Showing how a conversation or task can evolve through multiple turns, guiding the LLM in multi-step reasoning or dialogue.

## 16. Bias Mitigation Examples

Illustrating how to avoid or reduce biased responses from the LLM, promoting fair and equitable outcomes.

## 17. Performance Optimization Examples

Demonstrating efficient ways to achieve a desired result, guiding the LLM towards more optimal or concise outputs.
