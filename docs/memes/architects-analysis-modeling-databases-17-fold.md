# Architects: Analysis and Modeling - Databases - 17-Fold Division

This document applies a 17-fold division to the 'Databases' facet of 'Data Sources' under the 'Architects' archetype, providing a deeper level of granularity for understanding various types of database systems.

## 1. Relational Databases (SQL)

Traditional databases organizing data into structured tables with rows and columns, enforcing relationships through schemas (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle).

## 2. Document Databases

Storing data in flexible, semi-structured document formats (e.g., JSON, BSON), allowing for dynamic schemas (e.g., MongoDB, Couchbase).

## 3. Key-Value Stores

Simple databases storing data as collections of key-value pairs, optimized for high-speed read/write operations (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB).

## 4. Column-Family Databases

Storing data in columns rather than rows, optimized for wide columns and distributed architectures (e.g., Cassandra, HBase).

## 5. Graph Databases

Representing data as nodes and edges, optimized for storing and querying relationships between entities (e.g., Neo4j, Amazon Neptune).

## 6. Time-Series Databases

Optimized for storing and querying time-stamped data, often used for monitoring, IoT, and financial data (e.g., InfluxDB, TimescaleDB).

## 7. In-Memory Databases

Storing data primarily in RAM for extremely high-speed access and processing, often used for caching or real-time analytics (e.g., SAP HANA, Redis).

## 8. Search Engines (as databases)

Optimized for full-text search, indexing, and complex queries across large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data (e.g., Elasticsearch, Apache Solr).

## 9. Spatial Databases

Storing and querying geographical or spatial data, including points, lines, and polygons, often with specialized indexing (e.g., PostGIS, Oracle Spatial).

## 10. Ledger Databases

Immutable, append-only databases that provide a cryptographically verifiable history of all changes, suitable for verifiable transaction logs (e.g., Amazon QLDB).

## 11. Multi-Model Databases

Supporting multiple data models (e.g., document, graph, relational, key-value) within a single integrated database system (e.g., ArangoDB, OrientDB).

## 12. Cloud Databases

Managed database services offered by cloud providers, abstracting away infrastructure management (e.g., AWS RDS, Azure SQL Database, Google Cloud Spanner).

## 13. Embedded Databases

Databases designed to be part of an application, often lightweight and requiring no separate server process (e.g., SQLite, H2).

## 14. Distributed Databases

Data spread across multiple physical nodes or servers for scalability, high availability, and fault tolerance (e.g., Apache Cassandra, CockroachDB).

## 15. Data Warehouses

Optimized for analytical queries and reporting on large datasets, typically denormalized and designed for read-heavy workloads (e.g., Snowflake, Google BigQuery).

## 16. Data Lakes

Storing raw, unstructured, and semi-structured data in its native format, often used for big data analytics and machine learning (e.g., Hadoop HDFS, AWS S3).

## 17. Federated Databases

Integrating data from multiple, disparate databases or data sources as a single logical unit, allowing queries across heterogeneous systems.
