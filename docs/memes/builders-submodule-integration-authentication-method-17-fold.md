# Builders: Submodule Integration - Authentication Method - 17-Fold Division

This document applies a 17-fold division to the 'Authentication Method' facet of 'URL Specification' under the 'Builders' archetype, providing a deeper level of granularity for how access to submodule repositories is secured.

## 1. Username/Password

Traditional credential-based authentication where a user provides a username and a corresponding password for verification.

## 2. SSH Keys

Public-key cryptography for secure access, where a public key is stored on the server and a private key is held by the user.

## 3. Personal Access Tokens (PATs)

Fine-grained, revocable tokens issued by platforms (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) for API access, often with specific scopes and expiration.

## 4. OAuth/OAuth2

Token-based authorization flows for delegated access, allowing third-party applications to access resources on behalf of a user without sharing credentials.

## 5. Client Certificates

X.509 certificates used for mutual TLS authentication, where both the client and server verify each other's identity.

## 6. API Keys

Simple, often less secure, keys used to identify an application or user, typically passed as part of the URL or request header.

## 7. Bearer Tokens

Tokens (e.g., JWTs) passed in the Authorization header for stateless authentication, where the token itself contains all necessary information.

## 8. SAML/SSO

Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) or Single Sign-On (SSO) mechanisms for centralized user management and authentication in enterprise environments.

## 9. LDAP/Active Directory Integration

Integration with Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) or Active Directory for centralized user authentication and authorization.

## 10. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Requiring multiple forms of verification (e.g., something you know, something you have, something you are) to enhance security.

## 11. Biometric Authentication

Using unique biological characteristics (e.g., fingerprints, facial recognition, iris scans) for user verification.

## 12. Hardware Security Modules (HSM)

Physical computing devices that safeguard and manage digital keys, providing a secure environment for cryptographic operations.

## 13. Credential Helpers

Git's built-in mechanisms for securely storing and retrieving credentials, preventing repeated password prompts.

## 14. Environment Variables

Storing credentials or tokens as environment variables, which can be convenient but less secure if not properly managed.

## 15. Vault/Secret Management Systems

Centralized, secure storage and management solutions for secrets (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager), providing dynamic access.

## 16. Time-Based One-Time Passwords (TOTP)

Dynamically generated codes that are valid for a short period, commonly used as a second factor in MFA.

## 17. IP Whitelisting

Restricting access to the repository or service only to requests originating from a predefined list of trusted IP addresses.
