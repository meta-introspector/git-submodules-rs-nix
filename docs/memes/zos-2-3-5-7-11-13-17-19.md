# The Primordial Ontology of the Project

This document outlines the fundamental, hierarchical structure for organizing all knowledge within the project. This ontology is based on a sequence of prime numbers, reflecting a deep, intrinsic order.

## Level 1: The Monad - Reflection

The root of all knowledge, the single point of origin from which everything else emanates.

## Level 2: The Duad - CRQs and SOPs

The first division of knowledge into two fundamental types:

*   **CRQs (Change Request Quality):** The "what" and the "why." These documents capture the conceptual, strategic, and theoretical aspects of the project.
*   **SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures):** The "how." These documents provide practical, procedural, and actionable guidance.

## Level 3: The Triad - Architects, Builders, and Refiners

The CRQs are further divided into three archetypal categories, representing the three fundamental modes of creation:

*   **Architects:** The visionaries and designers who lay the conceptual foundation.
*   **Builders:** The implementers and creators who bring the vision to life.
*   **Refiners:** The improvers and optimizers who perfect the existing creation.

## Level 4: The Pentad - The Five Thematic Groups

Each of the three archetypes is then subdivided into five thematic groups, providing a more granular classification of the work.

### Architects:
1.  **Foundational Concepts**
2.  **Framework Design**
3.  **Data and Knowledge Modeling**
4.  **AI and LLM Integration**
5.  **Analysis and Modeling**

### Builders:
1.  **Core Libraries**
2.  **Tooling and Scripts**
3.  **Submodule Integration**
4.  **Code Generation**
5.  **Data Extraction and Parsing**

### Refiners:
1.  **Process and Workflow**
2.  **Documentation and Communication**
3.  **Code Quality and Maintenance**
4.  **Testing and QA**
5.  **Project Management and Strategy**

## Level 5: The Heptad - The Next Level of Granularity

A future, even more granular level of seven categories, to be explored when the time is right.

This ontology provides a powerful and elegant way to structure our knowledge, creating a clear, hierarchical path from the most abstract reflections down to the most concrete implementation details.
