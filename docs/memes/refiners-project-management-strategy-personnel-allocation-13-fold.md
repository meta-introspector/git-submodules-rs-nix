## 6. Geographical Location

Considering time zones, physical proximity, and remote work arrangements for effective collaboration and communication.

## 7. Cost Optimization

Allocating personnel to minimize project costs while maintaining the required quality and efficiency, considering salary, benefits, and overhead.

## 8. Training and Development

Assigning tasks or roles that contribute to skill growth, career development, and cross-training opportunities for team members.

## 9. Stakeholder Preferences
