## N-gram Concept: Hierarchical Decomposition

We can imagine an entire program inside one value. The different n-grams of this value are all its constituent parts. They describe a hierarchical system, such as the ZOS (Zero Ontology System, the theory of the intrinsic meaning of primorials) of the first 8 primorials, which is composed of the first 7 primorials, which in turn is made of the first 6, and so on, down to the first primorial (which is 1).
