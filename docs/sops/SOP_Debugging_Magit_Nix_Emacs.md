# SOP: Debugging Magit in Nix Emacs

## 1. Problem Statement

Magit.el is not loading in the Nix-built Emacs environment. Initial investigation indicates that Magit's Emacs Lisp files are not present in the expected `load-path` within the running Emacs instance, despite `init.org` configuring `use-package magit :ensure t`. This suggests a failure in how Magit is being packaged or included by the Nix build system.

## 2. Hypothesis

The `preBuild` step for `magit` within the `nix/packages/emacs-env/packageOverrides.nix` file might be failing or incorrectly placing the Magit files. This would prevent them from being properly included in the final Emacs derivation and subsequently loaded by Emacs.

## 3. Proposed Solution Steps

To diagnose and resolve this issue, the following steps are proposed:

### 3.1. Verify Nix Build Logs for `emacs-env`

Examine the Nix build logs for the `emacs-env` package. Look for any errors, warnings, or unusual output specifically related to the `magit` package's compilation or installation process. This can often reveal missing dependencies, compilation failures, or incorrect paths.

### 3.2. Inspect Nix Store Path for `emacs-env` Derivation

After a Nix build attempt, locate the actual path in the Nix store where the `emacs-env` package is installed. Manually inspect its contents to confirm whether Magit's files (`.el`, `.elc`) are present and located in the directories that Emacs expects to find them (i.e., on its `load-path`).

### 3.3. Test Magit Loading within Emacs

Utilize the existing `run_emacs_batch_test.sh` script, or create a minimal custom Emacs Lisp script, to programmatically check if Magit is loadable and functional within the Nix-built Emacs environment. This test should attempt to `(require 'magit)` and potentially call a basic Magit function to confirm its availability.

## 4. Next Actions

Proceed with executing the steps outlined in Section 3.0, starting with verifying the Nix build logs.
