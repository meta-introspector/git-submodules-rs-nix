**SOP: Apply Shellcheck Suggestions to Shell Scripts**

**Purpose:**
To ensure all shell scripts adhere to best practices and are free of common errors by applying suggestions from `shellcheck`. This SOP outlines the process for addressing `shellcheck` warnings and integrating the fixes into the codebase.

**Procedure:**

1.  **Identify Warnings:** Run `shellcheck` on the target script(s) to identify warnings and errors.
2.  **Analyze Suggestions:** Review `shellcheck`'s suggestions, understanding the rationale behind each.
3.  **Implement Fixes:** Modify the script(s) to incorporate the suggested fixes.
    *   For `SC2001` (e.g., `echo | sed` for string manipulation), prefer `${variable//search/replace}`.
    *   For `SC2028` (e.g., `echo` with escape sequences), prefer `printf`.
4.  **Verify Fixes:** Rerun `shellcheck` to confirm that the warnings are resolved.
5.  **Commit Changes:** Commit the changes with a clear commit message indicating the `shellcheck` fixes.

**Impact:**
Adhering to `shellcheck` suggestions improves script reliability, readability, and maintainability, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors and making scripts easier to understand and debug.
