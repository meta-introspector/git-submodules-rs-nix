# SOP: Refactoring with CRQ-Driven Branches

## Objective

To provide a systematic approach for refactoring existing code into CRQ-driven branches, ensuring that each refactored component or feature is encapsulated within its own Change Request Quality (CRQ) and associated Git branch, as per the "Bootstrap CRQ Hypothesis" (`CRQ-022`).

## Principles of Refactoring

### 1. Identify Refactoring CRQs

*   **Codebase Analysis:** Systematically analyze the existing codebase to identify areas that require refactoring. This could be based on code smells, technical debt, performance bottlenecks, or architectural improvements.
*   **CRQ Definition:** For each identified refactoring task, create a dedicated CRQ. This CRQ should clearly define the scope of the refactoring, the specific code to be changed, the expected improvements, and how its success will be measured.
*   **Granularity:** Break down large refactoring efforts into smaller, manageable CRQs. Each CRQ should aim to be as atomic as possible, focusing on a single logical change.

### 2. Branch per Refactoring CRQ

*   **Dedicated Branch:** Create a new Git branch specifically for each refactoring CRQ. This branch will house all changes related to that particular refactoring task.
*   **Branch Naming:** Use a clear naming convention for refactoring branches, linking them to their CRQ (e.g., `refactor/CRQ-XXX-module-cleanup`, `perf/CRQ-YYY-algorithm-optimization`).

### 3. Safe and Incremental Changes

*   **Small, Focused Commits:** Within the refactoring branch, make small, focused commits. Each commit should represent a logical step in the refactoring process, making it easier to review and revert if necessary.
*   **Continuous Testing:** Ensure that automated tests (unit, integration) are run frequently during the refactoring process to catch regressions early. New tests should be added to cover the refactored code.
*   **No New Features:** Strictly avoid introducing new features within a refactoring branch. The sole purpose of the branch is to refactor existing code.
*   **Rollback Strategy:** Plan for a clear rollback strategy in case issues are discovered after merging. This might involve preparing revert commits or having a clear understanding of how to quickly undo the refactoring if necessary.

### 4. 100% Readiness for Merge

*   **Functional Equivalence:** The refactored code must be functionally equivalent to the original code. All existing tests must pass, and ideally, new tests should be added to cover the refactored logic.
*   **Performance Benchmarks:** If the refactoring aims for performance improvements, ensure that benchmarks are run and the expected improvements are met.
*   **Code Review:** The refactored code must undergo a thorough code review, focusing on correctness, maintainability, and adherence to coding standards.
*   **Documentation Update:** Update any relevant documentation (e.g., inline comments, design documents) to reflect the refactoring changes.

### 5. Automation Support

*   **Script Utilization:** Leverage automation scripts (as defined in `CRQ-023`) for tasks such as branch creation, code migration (if applicable), and PR management.
*   **CI/CD Integration:** Integrate refactoring branches into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure automated testing and quality checks.

## Benefits

*   **Controlled Refactoring:** Provides a structured and disciplined approach to managing technical debt.
*   **Reduced Risk:** Minimizes the risk of introducing bugs during refactoring by isolating changes and enforcing rigorous testing.
*   **Improved Code Quality:** Leads to a cleaner, more maintainable, and performant codebase.
*   **Enhanced Collaboration:** Facilitates parallel refactoring efforts without significant merge conflicts.
*   **Living Documentation:** The CRQs and branches serve as a clear historical record of all refactoring efforts.

## Notes

*   Prioritize refactoring efforts based on impact, risk, and dependencies.
*   Regular communication within the team is crucial to coordinate refactoring efforts.
