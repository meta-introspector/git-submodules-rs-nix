**SOP: Task Management via Git Branch and CRQ/SOP Documents**

**Purpose:**
To streamline task management by directly linking the current development focus to the active Git branch and its corresponding CRQ (Change ReQuest) or SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) document. This ensures that the context and objectives of the current work are always clear and self-explanatory within the relevant document.

**Procedure:**

1.  **Identify Current Branch:** Determine the name of the active Git branch.
2.  **Locate Corresponding Document:** Find the CRQ or SOP document in `docs/crq_standardized/` or `docs/sops/` that matches the name or intent of the current branch.
3.  **Consult Document:** Refer to the identified CRQ or SOP document for detailed problem statements, proposed solutions, justification, and next steps. The document itself should provide all necessary context for the task.
4.  **Adhere to SOPs:** Always follow all relevant Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) during development.

**Impact:**
This approach simplifies task tracking, reduces cognitive load by centralizing task details, and reinforces the principle of atomic, self-contained changes. It promotes a clear, document-driven development workflow.
