## Conceptual Statement: Self-Referential Statement and Numbering

### Statement
"This is a new self referential statement so give it a new self referencial number."

### Interpretation
This statement is inherently meta, as it describes its own nature and dictates its own categorization within the documentation system. It highlights the recursive capacity of language and thought, where a concept can refer to itself and influence its own representation. The act of assigning it a "self referential number" (005 in this case) further emphasizes this self-referential loop, where the statement itself guides its placement and identification within the conceptual framework.
