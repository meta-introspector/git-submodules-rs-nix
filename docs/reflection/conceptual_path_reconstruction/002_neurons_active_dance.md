## Conceptual Statement: Neurons Active in Ritual of Truthing

### Statement
"We can say a set of neurons were active in some strange dance or ritual of truthing."

### Interpretation
This statement extends the concept of an idea's occupation of the mind to a more biological and metaphorical level. It suggests that the processing and validation of an idea (the "truthing") involves complex, dynamic neural activity, likened to a "strange dance" or "ritual." This implies that understanding and truth are not static, but emergent from intricate, active processes within the brain.
