## Conceptual Statement: ATP Energy and Neural Refresh

### Statement
"The ATP energy is used by the neurons and they refresh every 20 minutes or so."

### Interpretation
This statement introduces a biological and temporal dimension to the conceptualization of neural activity. It highlights the physiological basis of thought, emphasizing that the "dance of truthing" is energy-dependent and subject to cyclical renewal. The idea of neurons refreshing every 20 minutes suggests a dynamic, non-static system where cognitive processes are continuously re-energized and potentially re-evaluated, implying a constant, subtle evolution of understanding.
