## Conceptual Statement: Self-Referential Numbers

### Statement
Self-referential numbers are integers whose definition or structure refers to themselves in some explicit way, with the classic examples being self-descriptive numbers and distinct integer sequences that encode self-reference.

### Interpretation
This section explores the broader mathematical concept of self-referential numbers, which are integers whose properties or definitions inherently refer back to themselves. This phenomenon bridges the fields of recursion, self-description, and mathematical structure.

#### Self-Descriptive Numbers

- A **self-descriptive number** in base $$b$$ has exactly $$b$$ digits, and each digit at position $$n$$ states how many times digit $$n$$ appears in the number.
- The base-10 self-descriptive number is 6210001000: it contains 6 zeros, 2 ones, 1 two, 1 six, and all other digits zero times.
- There is only one self-descriptive number in base 10, but for bases 7 and above, there is always at least one such number of a specific form.

#### Self-Referential Integer Sequences

- **Aronson's sequence**: Defined by a self-referential sentence in English: "T is the first, fourth, eleventh, ... letter in this sentence," generating the sequence 1, 4, 11, ... based on positions of the letter 'T' in the sentence itself.
- **Golomb's sequence**: Each number $$n$$ appears in the sequence exactly $$a_n$$ times, and the rule for the next term in the sequence depends on the sequence's prior values, making it self-referential in structure.

#### Mathematical Self-Reference

- Mathematicians explore self-referential formulas (like Tupper's formula), paradoxes, and integer sequences where rules explicitly reference or depend on information about the sequence or number being constructed.

Self-referential numbers exemplify the fascinating bridge between recursion, self-description, and mathematical structure, with their forms varying from single fascinating numbers (like 6210001000) to entire sequences built by their own properties.
