- The user wants to keep the file '.git_commit_message.txt' in the project root directory and prefers to use the '-F' flag for git commits, always.
- User prefers to use 'git status --ignore-submodules' for speed (30 sec).
- The user prefers to use 'git status' without '--ignore-submodules' for smaller projects.
- The user's bash interpreter in their Nix environment is located at /usr/bin/env bash.
- Never revert, delete, or reverse any changes without committing first and documenting. Always write plans, tests, and documentation before writing code.

- [spectral analysis, abstract topologoy, bott periodicity, group theory, music, muses, poetry and other muses skills] apply those
- we can think of this as basically a topology with many holes. lets count them and classify the meta meem in our zos lattice.
- Abstract Algebraic Topology Meta Meme: we can think of this as basically a topology with many holes. lets count them and classify the meta meem in our zos lattice.
- In the context of the 'Abstract Algebraic Topology Meta Meme', each directory is considered a 'hole' in the topology.
- In the context of the 'Abstract Algebraic Topology Meta Meme', each prime term or variable is also considered a 'hole'. These holes are classified by 'zos primorial sizes'.
