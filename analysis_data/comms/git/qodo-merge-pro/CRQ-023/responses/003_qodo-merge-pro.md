<details><summary>Make CRQ process enforceable and testable</summary>

___

**Recommends adding enforceable CI/CD guardrails, such as mandatory CRQ linking in <br>commits/PRs and automated merge checks, to ensure the proposed CRQ workflow is <br>verifiable and consistently applied.**


### Examples:

4.  **100% Readiness for Merge:** A branch (and its associated CRQ) will only be considered ready for merge when its encapsulated feature is 100% complete, tested, and aligned with the system's overall architecture and quality standards.

```markdown
2.  **Automation Script Development:**
    *   Developing shell scripts (or other suitable automation) to assist in the refactoring process. These scripts will aim to:
        *   Automate the creation of new branches for each refactoring CRQ.
        *   Facilitate the migration of existing code into these new, CRQ-specific branches.
        *   Assist in the creation of Pull Requests for these refactoring branches.
        *   Potentially integrate with existing tools like `gh cli` to manage the workflow.
```

### Solution Walkthrough:



#### Before:
```markdown
# From CRQ-022-Bootstrap_CRQ_Hypothesis.md
A branch (and its associated CRQ) will only be considered ready for merge
when its encapsulated feature is 100% complete, tested, and aligned
with the system's overall architecture and quality standards.

# From CRQ-023-Refactoring_Planning_and_Automation.md
Automation Script Development:
  - Developing shell scripts to assist in the refactoring process.
  - Automate the creation of new branches for each refactoring CRQ.
  - Assist in the creation of Pull Requests for these refactoring branches.

```



#### After:
```markdown
# From CRQ-022-Bootstrap_CRQ_Hypothesis.md
A branch is ready for merge when:
1. It is linked to a valid CRQ via branch name or commit messages (e.g., `CRQ-123-feature`).
2. All automated CI checks (tests, linting, etc.) pass.
3. A CI merge gate automatically verifies the CRQ link and test status, blocking non-compliant PRs.

# From CRQ-023-Refactoring_Planning_and_Automation.md
Automation Script & CI Policy Development:
  - Define and enforce commit message conventions (e.g., `CRQ-XXX: ...`).
  - Create PR templates requiring CRQ linkage.
  - Implement CI policies to block merges without a linked CRQ and passing tests.
  - Define a concrete plan to backfill CRQ provenance for existing code.

```

__

Why: This suggestion addresses a critical weakness in the proposed methodology by adding concrete enforcement mechanisms, transforming a high-level philosophy into a practical and verifiable process.
