"100% ready" is referenced but not defined. Add a concrete Definition of Done/checklist (tests, documentation updates, CI status, backward compatibility, PR template requirements) to ensure consistent, auditable merges.

```markdown
*   Establishing clear criteria for what constitutes a "100% ready" feature for merging, as per `CRQ-022`.

Full traceability is a core claim, but the mechanism is unspecified. Define branch naming conventions, commit message schema including CRQ IDs, required PR metadata/labels, and cross-linking rules to reliably map code to CRQs.
</summary>

```markdown
1.  **CRQ-Driven System Genesis:** Every part of the system, including its initial setup and core functionalities, will be defined by a CRQ. This means that the "bootstrap" of the system is not a monolithic process but a sequence of CRQ-defined steps.
2.  **Refactoring into CRQ-Branches:** All existing code will undergo a systematic refactoring process. Each distinct feature, component, or logical unit will be isolated and encapsulated within its own Git branch, directly associated with a specific CRQ. This adheres to the "each branch is a CRQ is the system" philosophy.
3.  **Step-by-Step, Safe Construction:** By breaking down the system into CRQ-sized, branch-encapsulated units, we enable a highly granular, auditable, and safe construction process. Each merged PR (representing a completed CRQ-branch) incrementally builds the system.
4.  **100% Readiness for Merge:** A branch (and its associated CRQ) will only be considered ready for merge when its encapsulated feature is 100% complete, tested, and aligned with the system's overall architecture and quality standards.

Automation deliverables are high-level. Specify script entry points, inputs/outputs, idempotency and rollback strategy, error handling, required GitHub CLI version/auth, dry-run mode, and logging to make the work estimable and testable.
</summary>

```markdown
2.  **Automation Script Development:**
    *   Developing shell scripts (or other suitable automation) to assist in the refactoring process. These scripts will aim to:
        *   Automate the creation of new branches for each refactoring CRQ.
        *   Facilitate the migration of existing code into these new, CRQ-specific branches.
        *   Assist in the creation of Pull Requests for these refactoring branches.
        *   Potentially integrate with existing tools like `gh cli` to manage the workflow.

This effort will ensure that all future development, including the refactoring of legacy code, adheres to the principle of "each additional change to be in its own branch," thereby constructing the system in a step-by-step and safe manner.

### Expected Outcome

*   A detailed plan for refactoring the existing codebase into CRQ-driven branches.
*   A set of automation scripts that reduce manual effort in branch creation, code migration, and PR management for refactoring tasks.
*   Clear guidelines for future development to ensure adherence to the "Bootstrap CRQ Hypothesis."
